# Multi-Layer-Perceptron-w-Backpropagation
This is an implementation of multi-layer perceptron model from scratch, icluding all updates and backpropagation.
main.py file contains a neural network model, that can be initialized with any number of layers, neurons and activation function. This main file is used for 3
different projects, namely sinus,XOR,HandWritten files. As it is a course project, its problem definition and report are also included.
